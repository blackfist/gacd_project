## Fields
Here is what's contained in the data file.

```{r}
tempdata <- read.csv('file1.csv')
names(tempdata)
```

## Transformation
The file was made by combining the x\_train, y\_train, x\_test, y\_test, subjects\_test and subjects\_train files together like this

```
x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt")
train_subjects <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
train_merged_together <- data.frame(cbind(x_train, y_train, train_subjects))
rm(x_train, y_train, train_subjects)

x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
test_subjects <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
test_merged_together <- data.frame(cbind(x_test, y_test, test_subjects))
rm(x_test, y_test, test_subjects)

finalMerger <- rbind(train_merged_together, test_merged_together)
rm(train_merged_together, test_merged_together)
```

Then the features were read in from features.txt and we use the grep command to find all the fields that have "-mean" or
"-std" in the field name. This logical vector is used to subset the merged data from above to get a data set trimmed down to 
the interesting data.

```
# Now how to get the interesting features? Read from features.txt and use grep to find
# which fields have mean or std in them.
feature_list <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
interesting_columns <- grep("(-mean|-std)", feature_list$V2)
# we need the last two columns also so we'll manually add that to our interesting_columns
interesting_columns <- c(interesting_columns, 562, 563)
trimmed_data <- finalMerger[, interesting_columns]
names(trimmed_data) <- c(grep("(-mean|-std)", feature_list$V2, value = T),
                        "activityid", "subjectid")
```

To get the mean value of each variable for each permutation of subjectid and activityid, we start by melting the dataset and
identifying subjectid and activityid as identity variables. Then we use dcast to get the mean for each of the variables.

```
melted_data <- melt(trimmed_data, id.vars=c("activityid","subjectid"))
final_result <- dcast(melted_data, subjectid + activityid ~ variable, mean)
```
